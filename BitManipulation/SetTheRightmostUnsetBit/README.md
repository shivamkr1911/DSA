# Set the Rightmost Unset Bit

Given a non-negative number `n`, the task is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of `n`.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
n = 6

**Output:**  
7

**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of 6 is `110`. After setting the rightmost unset bit, it becomes `111`, which is 7.

---

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
n = 15

**Output:**  
31

**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of 15 is `01111`. After setting the rightmost unset bit, it becomes `11111`, which is 31.

## Expected Time Complexity:

O(Log n)

---

## Expected Auxiliary Space:

O(1)

---

## Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^9
