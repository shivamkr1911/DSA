# Find XOR of Numbers from L to R

You are given two integers **L** and **R**, your task is to find the XOR of all elements in the range **[L, R]**.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
L = 4, R = 8

**Output:**  
8

**Explanation:**  
4 ^ 5 ^ 6 ^ 7 ^ 8 = 8

## Your Task:

Implement the function **findXOR(l, r)** which takes two integers `l` and `r` and returns the XOR of numbers from `l` to `r`.

---

## Expected Time Complexity:

- **O(1)**

## Expected Auxiliary Space:

- **O(1)**

---

## Constraints:

- 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10⁹
