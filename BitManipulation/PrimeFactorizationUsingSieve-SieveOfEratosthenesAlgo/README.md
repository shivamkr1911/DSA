# Prime Factorization using Sieve

You are given a positive number **N**. Using the concept of Sieve, compute its prime factorization.

---

## Example:

Input:  
N = 12246

Output:  
2 3 13 157

Explanation:  
2 _ 3 _ 13 \* 157 = 12246 = N

---

## Task:

Complete the function `findPrimeFactors()`, which takes a positive number **N** as input and returns a vector consisting of prime factors. You should implement the Sieve algorithm to solve this problem.

---

## Expected Time Complexity:

O(N log(log(N)))

---

## Expected Auxiliary Space:

O(N)

---

## Constraints:

2 <= N <= 2 \* 10⁵
