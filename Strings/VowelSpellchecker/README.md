# Vowel Spellchecker

Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.

For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:

1. **Capitalization:**  
   If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.

   **Examples:**

   - wordlist = ["yellow"], query = "YellOw" → correct = "yellow"
   - wordlist = ["Yellow"], query = "yellow" → correct = "Yellow"
   - wordlist = ["yellow"], query = "yellow" → correct = "yellow"

2. **Vowel Errors:**  
   If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.

   **Examples:**

   - wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yollow" → correct = "YellOw"
   - wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yeellow" → correct = "" (no match)
   - wordlist = ["YellOw"], query = "yllw" → correct = "" (no match)

## Precedence Rules

1. When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), return the same word.
2. When the query matches a word up to capitalization, return the first such match in the wordlist.
3. When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, return the first such match in the wordlist.
4. If the query has no matches in the wordlist, return the empty string.

Given some queries, return a list of words `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the correct word for `query = queries[i]`.

## Example 1

**Input:**  
wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"]  
queries = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]

**Output:**  
["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]

---

## Example 2

**Input:**  
wordlist = ["yellow"]  
queries = ["YellOw"]

**Output:**  
["yellow"]

## Constraints

- 1 <= wordlist.length, queries.length <= 5000
- 1 <= wordlist[i].length, queries[i].length <= 7
- wordlist[i] and queries[i] consist only of English letters
