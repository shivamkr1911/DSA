# Power Of Numbers

Given a number `n`, find the value of `n` raised to the power of its own reverse.

**Note:** The result will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer.

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
n = 2

**Output:**  
4

**Explanation:**  
The reverse of 2 is 2, and 2² = 4.

---

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
n = 10

**Output:**  
10

**Explanation:**  
The reverse of 10 is 1 (leading zero is discarded), and 10 raised to the power 1 is 10.

## Constraints:

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10
