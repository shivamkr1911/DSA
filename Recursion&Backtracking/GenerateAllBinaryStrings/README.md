# Generate All Binary Strings

Given an integer `n`, you need to generate all the binary strings of `n` characters representing bits.

**Note:** Return the strings in ascending order.

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
n = 2

**Output:**  
[00, 01, 10, 11]

**Explanation:**  
As each position can be either 0 or 1, the total possible combinations are 4.

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
n = 3

**Output:**  
[000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111]

**Explanation:**  
As each position can be either 0 or 1, the total possible combinations are 8.
