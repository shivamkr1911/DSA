# Search in Linked List

Given a linked list of `n` nodes and a `key`, the task is to check if the key is present in the linked list or not.

---

### Example:
```
Input: n = 4, key = 3
1->2->3->4
Output: true
Explanation: 3 is present in Linked List, so the function returns true.
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵  
- 1 ≤ key ≤ 10⁵
