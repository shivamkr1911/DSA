# Find Length of Linked List

Given head of a singly linked list, the task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

---

### Example 1:
```
Input: head : 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 5, as there are 5 nodes present in it.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: head : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
Output: 7
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 7, as there are 7 nodes present in it.
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 4 × 10⁴  
- 1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10³
