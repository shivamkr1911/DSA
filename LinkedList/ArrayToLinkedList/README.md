# Array to Linked List

Given an array of integers `arr`, your task is to construct the linked list from `arr` and return the head of the linked list.

### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Explanation: Linked list for the given array will be
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 1, 0]
Output: LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
Explanation: Linked list for the given array will be
```

### Expected Time Complexity:
- O(n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space:
- O(n)

---

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10⁶  
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁶
