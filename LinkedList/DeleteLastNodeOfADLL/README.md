# Delete Last Node of a Doubly Linked List

A doubly-linked list is a data structure that consists of sequentially linked nodes, and the nodes have references to both the previous and the next nodes in the sequence of nodes.

Given a doubly-linked list, delete the node at the end of the doubly linked list.

**Note:**  
You need not print anything. You’re given the head of the linked list, just return the head of the modified list.

### Example:
```
Input:
Linked List: 4 <-> 10 <-> 3 <-> 5 <-> 20

Output:
Modified Linked List: 4 <-> 10 <-> 3 <-> 5

Explanation:
The last node having ‘data’ = 20 is removed from the linked list.
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000  
- 1 ≤ Data of a node in linked list ≤ 10⁹
