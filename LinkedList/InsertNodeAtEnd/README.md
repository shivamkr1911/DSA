# Insert Node at End of Linked List

Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value `x`, insert that value `x` at the end of the linked list and return the modified linked list.

---

### Example 1:
```
Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5, x = 6
Output: 1->2->3->4->5->6
Explanation: We can see that 6 is inserted at the end of the linked list.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: LinkedList: 5->4, x = 1
Output: 5->4->1
Explanation: We can see that 1 is inserted at the end of the linked list.
```

### Expected Time Complexity:
- O(n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space:
- O(1)

---

### Constraints:
- 0 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10⁵  
- 1 ≤ node->data, x ≤ 10³
