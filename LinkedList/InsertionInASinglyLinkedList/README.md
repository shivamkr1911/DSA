# Insertion in a Singly Linked List

You are given a Singly Linked List of `N` positive integers. Your task is to add a node having the value `VAL` at position `POS` in the linked list.

**Note:**  
Assume that the indexing for the linked list starts from 0.

### Example:
```
Input: N = 5, LIST = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4], VAL = 2, POS = 1
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Explanation: The node with value 2 is inserted at position 1.
```

---

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10  
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁴  
- 0 ≤ POS ≤ N  
- 1 ≤ data, VAL ≤ 10⁷

Where `N` is the size of the singly linked list, and `data` is the integer data of the singly linked list.
