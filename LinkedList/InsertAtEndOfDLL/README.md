# Insert at End of Doubly Linked List

A doubly-linked list is a data structure that consists of sequentially linked nodes, and the nodes have references to both the previous and the next nodes in the sequence of nodes.

Given a doubly-linked list and a value `k`, insert a node having value `k` at the end of the doubly linked list and return the head of the modified list.

**Note:**
You are given the head of the linked list. Return the head of the modified list. You do not need to print anything.

### Example:

```
Input:
Linked List:
4 <-> 10 <-> 3 <-> 5
k = 20

Output:
4 <-> 10 <-> 3 <-> 5 <-> 20

Explanation:
A new node having value k = 20 is inserted at the end of the linked list.
```

### Constraints:

* 0 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
* 1 ≤ Value in linked list ≤ 10⁹
* 1 ≤ k ≤ 10⁹
