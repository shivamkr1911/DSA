### Example 1:

```
Input:
LinkedList: 3 <-> 4 <-> 5

Output:
5 <-> 4 <-> 3
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
LinkedList: 75 <-> 122 <-> 59 <-> 196

Output:
196 <-> 59 <-> 122 <-> 75
```

### Expected Time Complexity:

* O(n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space:

* O(1)

---

### Constraints:

* 1 <= number of nodes <= 10⁶
* 0 <= node->data <= 10⁴
