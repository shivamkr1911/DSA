# Delete X-th Node of Linked List

Given a singly linked list and an integer `x`, delete the `x-th` node (1-based indexing) from the singly linked list.

---

### Example 1:
```
Input: Linked list: 1 -> 3 -> 4, x = 3
Output: 1 -> 3
Explanation: After deleting the node at the 3rd position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as 1 -> 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: Linked list: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9, x = 2
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 9
Explanation: After deleting the node at 2nd position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as 1 -> 2 -> 9.
```

### Constraints:
- 2 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 10⁶  
- 1 ≤ x ≤ size of linked list
