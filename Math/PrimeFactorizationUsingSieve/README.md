# Prime Factorization using Sieve

Given a positive number **N**, compute its prime factorization using the concept of **Sieve of Eratosthenes**.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:** N = 12246

**Output:** 2 3 13 157

**Explanation:** 2 × 3 × 13 × 157 = 12246 = N

---

## Your Task:

Complete the function **`findPrimeFactors()`**, which takes a positive number **N** as input and returns a vector consisting of prime factors.  
You should implement the **Sieve algorithm** to solve this problem.

## Expected Time Complexity:

**O(N log(log(N)))**

## Expected Auxiliary Space:

**O(N)**

---

## Constraints:

- 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10⁵
