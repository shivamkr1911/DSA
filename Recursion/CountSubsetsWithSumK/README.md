# Count Subsets with Sum K

You are given an array **arr** of size **n** containing positive integers and a target sum **k**.

Find the number of ways of selecting the elements from the array such that the sum of chosen elements is equal to the target **k**.

Since the number of ways can be very large, print it modulo **10^9 + 7**.

---

### Example:

```
Input:
arr = [1, 1, 4, 5]

Output:
3
```

**Explanation:**  
The possible ways are:

- [1, 4]
- [1, 4]
- [5]

Hence the output will be **3**.  
Please note that both 1s present in **arr** are treated differently.
