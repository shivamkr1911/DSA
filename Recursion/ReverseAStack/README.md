# Reverse a Stack

You are given a stack **St**. You have to reverse the stack using recursion.

---

### Example 1:

```
Input:
St = [3,2,1,7,6]

Output:
[6,7,1,2,3]

Explanation:
Input stack after reversing will look like the stack in the output.
```

---

### Example 2:

```
Input:
St = [4,3,9,6]

Output:
[6,9,3,4]

Explanation:
Input stack after reversing will look like the stack in the output.
```

### Constraints:

- 1 ≤ stack.size ≤ 10^4
- 0 ≤ stack.element ≤ 10^3
