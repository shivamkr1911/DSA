# Rotate Array

> Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

---

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3  
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]  
Explanation:  
After 1 step: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]  
After 2 steps: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]  
After 3 steps: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2  
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]  
Explanation:  
After 1 step: [99,-1,-100,3]  
After 2 steps: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

---

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-2³¹ <= nums[i] <= 2³¹ - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10⁵`

---

### Follow-up:
- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can.  
- Can you solve it **in-place** with **O(1)** extra space?
