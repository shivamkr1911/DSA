# Count Number of Nice Subarrays

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A continuous subarray is called **nice** if there are exactly `k` odd numbers in it.

Return the number of nice subarrays.

---

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: 2
```

Explanation: The only subarrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].

---

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
Output: 0
```

Explanation: There are no odd numbers in the array.

---

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 16
```

### Constraints:

- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 50,000
- 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ k ≤ nums.length
